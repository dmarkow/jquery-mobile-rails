= Jquery Mobile for Rails

This gem adds the JQuery Mobile files to the rails assets pipeline.

==== Gem's JQuery Mobile Version

1.3.1 (gem 1.3.1)

=== Instalation

Add this gem to your Gemfile:

    gem 'jquery_mobile_rails'

This will include to your assets pipeline the jquery mobile's javascripts, stylesheets and images.

Insert into your application.js manifest the jquery.mobile (or jquery.mobile.min)

    //= require jquery
    //= require jquery_ujs
    //= require jquery.mobile

And the same to your application.css manifest:

    *= require_self
    *= require_tree .
    *= require jquery.mobile


=== Use

I built this gem for using with the Mobylette gem, but it will work with your stand alone application, or with any other gem that filters your mobile requests.

For layouting using JQuery Mobile, and using all its features, I suggest your give a look at their documentation: http://jquerymobile.com/test/


=== Example

Inside the test/dummy there is a simple application using a very basic jquery mobile templating.

== Different versions

By default, jquery_mobile_rails gem will provide latest stable version of JQM.
Besides that you can switch to other versions by selecting a different branch.

For example, to use 1.2.0-alpha.1, update your Gemfile to:

  gem "jquery_mobile_rails", git: "git://github.com/tscolari/jquery-mobile-rails.git", branch: "1.2.0-alpha.1"

== Pull Requests

Please, this steps help a lot the merge proccess:

* Copy jquery mobile files to vendor/assets/(javascripts|stylesheets|images)/
* Remove version number from the file names
* place images in the sub-directory named 'jquery-mobile' (vendor/assets/images/jquery-mobile)
* run the rake task `jquery_mobile_rails_css_fix`. This will ensure that the images in the css will be loaded using `image-url()` instead of `url()`, and it will convert the file to scss.
